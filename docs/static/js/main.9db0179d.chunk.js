Going back as far as elementary school, art was my favorite part of the school day. Drawing and making sketches was my first love because you can do it anywhere and it doesnt cost a lot to get into. However, as I have gotten older,  I have enjoyed learning about different mediums and styles of art. College has allowed me to grow as both an artist and a person.

I gained many new skills over the course of the semester and I'm grateful for the opportunity to venture into unfamiliar territory.  Over the last four years, I have had the opportunity to diversify my skill set as an artist, as well as my personal portfolio of pieces."}),Object(m.jsx)("img",{className:"sky",src:r})]})};a.p,a(10);var g=function(){return Object(m.jsx)("div",{className:"App",children:Object(m.jsx)(f,{})})},h=function(e){e&&e instanceof Function&&a.e(3).then(a.bind(null,12)).then((function(t){var a=t.getCLS,s=t.getFID,n=t.getFCP,i=t.getLCP,o=t.getTTFB;a(e),s(e),n(e),i(e),o(e)}))};o.a.render(Object(m.jsx)(n.a.StrictMode,{children:Object(m.jsx)(g,{})}),document.getElementById("root")),h()},8:function(e,t,a){}},[[11,1,2]]]);
